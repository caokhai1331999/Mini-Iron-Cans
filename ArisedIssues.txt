    // TODO: *HARD* Turn out the only solution to afoot is just rewrite data on the
    // previous bullet DONE!

+ Bot Tank move one way and stuck in level width or height
(Solved for userTank by set veclocity to 0 everytime new input is accept ) DONE!

+ Bot Tank stuck to the level height when spawn near them DONE!

+ UserTank can not fire when get near bot tank????? Don't know why It auto run
fire() everytime userTank get near botTank (FIXED)

+ UserTank can not fire when getting near the bottom of the level (fixed bugs
happened when I forgot to synthesize the LEVEL_WIDTH in whole and LEVEL_WIDTH in
BULLET check function)

+ First hit tank display the 2nd frame of image then stuck there, the rest
didn't even show anything related to explosion effect and disappear
after was hit (!done)

+ An idea spark in my mind recently. Should I use the loop through the enemyTank
to track and render the explosion every time it hit. Or I just need to send a
signal every time a tank is hit to render an explosion to the pointed
accordinates???? (On the way to check and fix) (Seem like the 2nd ideas doesn't
work well)

+ After redrawing a new tile's background, Game's latency delay too much. There
must be something happened to the memory (maybe related to how I set the tiles
up, It's wrong somewhere)
    . It's seem like when I don't use toucheswall function which loop check for
    collision between tank and wall. The Game's latency seem decrease obviously
 * Found out the issues, I passed unused Tile's pointer to move's loop
 tank. which caused game lag

+ Where should I boil down the state revolving machine into?? In menu function
or Update one


** Done flag is on but game refused to end(SOLVED)
     *** BY delegate task to each function : ProcessInput(Get Menu Choice And
     Hint to change state and change state); Update (Run the Game accordingly or
     Change done flag when it empty state) and Render (Render accordingly or
     close if it's empty state) (**** Why the Loop won't end right after changing
     flags) -- Because the loop check follow stack order which have to go
     the end of the stack in current turn then go back to the condition check
     for the next turn -- That also explain why bug arrived and app refused to stop
     after turn the flag on because there was no closing task yet!!???
     *** The main thing that solve bug is that I put close inside render fx to
     clean up on time before getting out of loop
** Beside that I deleted the Platform and tileSet before I close everything in
it

?? Main Scene messed up. May be the SDL_getTick and the Position in everyFrame
   seemed not calculated well (Big Problem)
   ?? latest Update: When choose new game. The Game run in a messed up way. But
   after get to menu and choose resume. It then work like nearly normal but
   still so fast. MAY BE THE RESET GAME MAKE 
     *** ISSUE FIXED: I recklessly put the reset game properties in the
   constantly running update fx

?? The explosion texture span in an unexpected size

?? The respawn part of code which include the while loop checking for respawn
time drawing from SDL_GetTicks hold game down really much
     ** Fixed:
        // NOTE: As for the output debug infor. I Can see that the
        // respawnTime check is flawed. It never meet the condition (>1s) to
        respawn the tank. Cause the time is secured at 1s

??? POSITION COLLISION BUG:
      ? User tanks stuck with enemyTank. Then can not move
      ? bot tanks stuck at border. Then can not be hit
