    // TODO: *HARD* Turn out the only solution to afoot is just rewrite data on the
    // previous bullet DONE!

+ Bot Tank move one way and stuck in level width or height
(Solved for userTank by set veclocity to 0 everytime new input is accept )

+ Bot Tank stuck to the level height when spawn near them

+ UserTank can not fire when get near bot tank????? Don't know why It auto run
fire() everytime userTank get near botTank (FIXED)

+ UserTank can not fire when getting near the bottom of the level (fixed bugs
happened when I forgot to synthesize the LEVEL_WIDTH in whole and LEVEL_WIDTH in
BULLET check function)

+ First hit tank display the 2nd frame of image then stuck there, the rest
didn't even show anything related to explosion effect and disappear
after was hit (!done)

+ An idea spark in my mind recently. Should I use the loop through the enemyTank
to track and render the explosion every time it hit. Or I just need to send a
signal every time a tank is hit to render an explosion to the pointed
accordinates???? (On the way to check and fix)

+ The Animation is too fast to track
