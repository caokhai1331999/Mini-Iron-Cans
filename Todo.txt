TODO:
 - Shipping game (separate it to many portable files) (DONE!)
 - Try writing Platform in Procedure and OOP/OOD styles (DONE!)

TODO:

- Start to use this to make my first tank game :
- Time adjust the dot mbox size (DONE!)

- First: 1 Create user tank and enemy tank *
            - Create enemy tank info : + Randomize its position (DONE)
                                       + Apply those information to Texture
            - Render (DONE)
            
                                       + Resize the sprite to smaller one (DONE!)
                                       
                                       + Delve deeper to know how the camera
                                       way work and apply it to make the camera
                                       faster.(DONE!)

                                       ** REMEMBER : Object Position subtract to
                                       camera Pos to create moving effect for
                                       the background or non main object

                                       ** Camera moving pos based on main object
                                          moving Pos + object size - camera size
                                          to make camera follow it

                                       +Arising problem tank move diagonally
                                       while pressing two arrow buttons (DONE!)

                                       
                                        next step
                                       + Use Dijktra algorithm to guide way for
                                       bot tanks to automatically move them
                                       around (WORKING)
                                       + Enable them to shoot **
                                         . DONE: User and bot tank
                                       + DONE: Make enemy Tank to shoot whenever
                                       the user tank is nearby(WORKING)
** : Time to apply collision box to make them  enable kill each other
                                       
         5 Time to redraw the map make the map drawing after the camera moving (WORKING)

- Second: 1 Begin to delve more to create my own map
          2 I may have to redraw the map to make it bigger.
          3 Then devle more to understand how to scroll the background map

- Finally: After majority of the game engine, time for shipping code, manage
  gamestate and specific memory allocation
