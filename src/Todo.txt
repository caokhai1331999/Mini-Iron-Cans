* I coincidentally fix the slow closing issue by adding delete menu and frame
  array of integer in closing fx

* Finally understand the game loop and remove the wrong loop for explosion
  effect. The game loop is already made it run. All I just need to do to set
  conidtion to make it revolving

* Time to redraw and resized map with concrete wall and reduce tank sprite size
